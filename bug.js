This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a package.json file containing an incorrect or missing dependency version. It's often related to the Expo modules or other dependencies required by your project.  The error might manifest as a cryptic message during installation, build, or start processes. A specific example would be `Error: Can't resolve 'expo-constants' in '/path/to/your/project/node_modules/expo-location/build'
