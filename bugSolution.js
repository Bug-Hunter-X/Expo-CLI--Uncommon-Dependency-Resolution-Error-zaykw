The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the versions of your dependencies in the `package.json`.  Ensure that all Expo module versions are compatible with your project's Expo SDK version. Often, running `npm install` or `yarn install` after correcting the `package.json` fixes the issue.  If the problem persists, consider using `npm prune` or `yarn why` to investigate dependency conflicts. You may need to remove `node_modules` and reinstall to fully resolve. Example Fix:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.0",
    "expo-constants": "^13.0.0",
    "expo-location": "^15.0.0" // Ensure correct version compatibility 
  }
}
```
