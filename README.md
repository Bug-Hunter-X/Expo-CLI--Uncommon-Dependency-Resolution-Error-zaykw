This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The issue stems from inconsistencies in package.json dependency versions, specifically those involving Expo modules.  The `bug.js` file shows a project with an incorrectly configured `package.json`, leading to build failures. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  This is an edge case error not often documented.
